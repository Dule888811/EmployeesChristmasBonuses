An HR manager responsible for 1000 employees numbered from 1 to 1000. Your boss told you to give a big Christmas bonus to employees, but didn’t tell you their names. Instead they gave you two indications:

the sum of the proper divisors (including 1 but not itself) of the employee number is greater than the employee number itself
no subset of those divisors sums to the employee number itself.
